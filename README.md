## Indoor locator via wifi

Our team is developing a robot🤖 that, through the **triangulation** 📐 of the different WiFi networks of our school, is able to **orient** itself within the school buildings 🏫.

# Initial Roadmap 🗺️

 1. Turn on and configure the Raspberry Pi
 2. Build the robot
 3. Prepare the Arduino with the motor shield
 4. And start writing the programs!

## Future Planning ↗️

The general plan is to start the hardware and software part simultaneously. 
Once the preparations related to the hardware part have been completed, we will proceed with the first test phase, hopefully with working software.

## Technologies Used 🖥️

The main technologies we will use are **lidar** for mapping the environment and managing the movements of the robot in small spaces and **wifi** for triangulating the position inside the internal rooms.
On the software side we will use **Python** as a programming language and various libraries to be able to communicate with everything; then we will use **C** for programming an Arduino.
On the hardware side, a **Raspberry Pi** will be used as the main brain and an **Arduino Uno** for managing the motors.
